  "description": "Quickly and accurately scan PDF417 bardcodes from the backs of Drivers Licenses and Health ID cards directly into web-based EMRs using inexpensive laser barcode scanners.  To simplify the scanning process, this packge intercepts these scan events to translate them into subscribable `healthIdScan` or `aamvaIdScan` events.  When these events are triggered, you will receive a Javascript object that provides the details from the ID that are pertinent to healthcare settings.",
